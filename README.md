# OOP-practice (C#)
Small console drills to practice OOP basics (classes, lists, composition).  
Folders = short exercises; some repeated (“zombies”) to show iteration/refactor.

## How to run
- `dotnet run --project 02-library/02-library.csproj` (example)

## Highlights
- 02-library: basic search (`FindBook`)
- 05-movies: collection + print
- 04-zombies: progression: 0401 → 0415 (refactor steps)

## Notes
This is a practice sandbox, not a product. No course materials included.
